                Project "CryptoSphere" transforms raw market data into a visually dynamic sphere that encapsulates the volatility and sentiment of the Bitcoin market. <br>
The sphere's size is directly influenced by Bitcoin's market capitalization, serving as a tangible representation of its financial magnitude. <br>
The coloration of the sphere is based on a logarithmic regression, plotting Bitcoin's price against time but colored in bands that represent different market sentiments, from undervalued to overvalued regions. <br>
Morphing intensity is driven by daily price changes, visualizing the market's volatility. <br>
Through this interactive and immersive visualization, the project aims to offer an engaging and intuitive way to perceive complex financial data, providing insights into the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market. <br>
